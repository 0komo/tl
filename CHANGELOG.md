# 0.3.0

2020-04-27

This is the first release with the simplified syntax
for generics, without requiring backticks!

## What's new

Besides the usual bugfixes (see the Git history for
details), here are the main changes:

### Language changes

* Type variables no longer need backticks: you can
  declare `function<T, U>(x: T): U` and use `T` and
  `U` as types inside the function
* Base type declarations can contain parentheses for
  clarity, e.g. `{string: (string|number)}`
* More standard library typing improvements

## Tooling

* `--include`/`-I` flag for including directories
  to the module search path
* `tl run` now auto-invokes the Teal package loader,
  so `.tl` files running with it can `require()`
  other `.tl` files without needing to use `tl gen`
  to generate `.lua` files first.
* `tl run` can also pass arguments to the running
  program again

# 0.2.0

2020-04-08

This is the first release where the language is
officially named Teal!

## What's new

Lots of bugfixes, as well as language changes, tooling
improvements and beginnings of documentation!

### Language changes

* Union types, still restricted (can only union between
  at most one table type and a non-table type -- in other
  words, type resolution at runtime happens using the
  Lua `type()`)
  * `is` operator for specializing union types with a test
* `goto` and labels
* Type variables need to be declared in functions with
  angle brackets: `function<...>` (this fixes scoping rules)
* `global function` is now valid syntax
* Accepts any element type on a table typed `{any:any}`.
* Booleans are stricter
* Disallow extending records with functions outside of
  original scope
* Standard library typing improvements

### Tooling

* New command-line parser using argparse,
  typecheck using `tl check`
* `-l` command line option for requiring libraries
* `--skip-compat53` flag
* Detects `lua` hashbang to enter lax mode

# 0.1.0

2020-02-02

First tagged release! Announced at FOSDEM 2020.
